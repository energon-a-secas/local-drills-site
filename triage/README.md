# Ticket Triage

You receive a support ticket describing a failure. Read it, form a hypothesis, run diagnostic commands, find the root cause.

These drills train a different skill than break-fix labs. Instead of a known broken config file, you start with vague or misleading symptoms — the way real incidents arrive.

## How It Works

Each drill presents:

1. **The Ticket** — what the user reported. May include red herrings or missing context.
2. **Your Environment** — a lab-initialization script sets up the broken state.
3. **Diagnostic Checklist** — suggested commands to investigate (hidden by default in the solution).
4. **Root Cause + Fix** — what actually went wrong and how to resolve it.

## Approach

When you read a ticket, ask yourself:

- **What exactly is the symptom?** (502 error, pod crashing, pipeline failing)
- **What changed recently?** (deploy, config update, dependency bump — or "nothing")
- **What would I check first?** (logs, events, recent changes, resource status)
- **What's the simplest explanation?** (typo, misconfiguration, wrong environment)

## Setup

Each triage drill uses the same infrastructure as its parent section:

- **AWS drills**: LocalStack must be running (`cd ../aws && make run`)
- **Kubernetes drills**: Minikube must be running (`cd ../kubernetes && make start`)
- **GitLab drills**: gitlab-ci-local via docker-compose (`cd ../gitlab && make start`)

## Drills

| Drill | Section | Difficulty | Symptom |
